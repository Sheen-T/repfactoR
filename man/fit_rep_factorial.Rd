\title{Fit a replicated 2^k factorial model with all interactions}
\usage{
fit_rep_factorial(data, response, factors)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the response column and factor columns.}

\item{response}{Character scalar; the name of the response column.}

\item{factors}{Character vector; names of the two-level factor columns.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"repfact_fit"}: a list with components
\describe{
\item{data}{The input data with factor columns standardized to \eqn{-1/+1} factors.}
\item{formula}{The model formula used (e.g., \code{y ~ A*B*C}).}
\item{fit}{The underlying \code{lm} fit.}
\item{effects}{Named numeric vector of Yates-scaled effect estimates. The intercept is labeled \code{grand.mean}.}
\item{effects_ci}{A two-column matrix of 95\% confidence intervals for effects (scaled consistently).}
}
}
\description{
Fits a full factorial linear model (main effects + all interactions) for a design with
two-level factors. Factors are expected to be coded as \eqn{-1} and \eqn{+1}.
If a factor is coded as \eqn{0/1} or as two text levels, the function attempts to
recode it to \eqn{-1/+1}.
}
\details{
For balanced \eqn{2^k} designs using \eqn{-1/+1} coding, each non-intercept coefficient
from the fitted model corresponds to half of the classical factorial \emph{effect}. This
function therefore reports \strong{Yates-scaled effects} as:
\deqn{\widehat{\text{effect}} = 2 \times \widehat{\beta}}
for each non-intercept term.

Replication (multiple observations per design point) provides an estimate of pure error,
enabling standard errors, confidence intervals, and t-tests in the usual linear model summary.
