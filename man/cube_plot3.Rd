\title{Cube plot for a 3-factor replicated factorial fit}
\usage{
cube_plot3(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{"repfact_fit"} object returned by \code{\link[=fit_rep_factorial]{fit_rep_factorial()}}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data.frame of the 8 factor combinations and predicted means.
}
\description{
Draws a simple cube-style visualization for designs with exactly three two-level factors.
The plot shows the 8 model-predicted means at the vertices corresponding to the \eqn{(-1,+1)^3}
factor combinations. This function does not require a specialized design object.
}
\examples{
fit <- fit_rep_factorial(
  toydata,
  response = "Overall_liking",
  factors  = c("Milk", "Packaging", "Species")
)
cube_plot3(fit)

}
