\title{Toy coffee preference dataset (replicated 2^3 factorial)}
\format{
A data frame with 16 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
\item{Respondent}{Integer respondent id.}
\item{Overall_liking}{Numeric response (overall preference score).}
\item{Milk}{Two-level factor coded \eqn{-1/+1}.}
\item{Packaging}{Two-level factor coded \eqn{-1/+1}.}
\item{Species}{Two-level factor coded \eqn{-1/+1}.}
}
}
\usage{
toydata

\description{
A small teaching dataset used to demonstrate analysis of a replicated \eqn{2^3} factorial design.
The response is an overall liking score for coffee, measured for 16 respondents. The three
factors (\code{Milk}, \code{Packaging}, \code{Species}) each take two levels and are coded as
\eqn{-1} (low) and \eqn{+1} (high).
}
\details{
This dataset mimics a replicated factorial design: multiple respondents provide responses
across the 8 design points (all combinations of three two-level factors). Replication enables
estimation of residual variance (pure error) and standard inference for effects.
