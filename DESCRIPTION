Description: Provides lightweight, teaching-oriented utilities to analyze replicated
    2^k factorial designs where each factor has two levels. The package fits full
    factorial linear models (all interactions) using {-1, +1} coding, reports
    Yates-scaled effect estimates (effect = 2 * coefficient) with confidence intervals,
    and provides an ANOVA-style coefficient table. A simple cube plot visualizes
    model-predicted means for 3-factor designs without requiring specialized design
    objects. Includes a small coffee preference toy dataset.
